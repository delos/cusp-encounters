# This file computes a set of orbits in the Milky Way potential
#
# If you use the recommended the default setup of the repository, and you
# have downloaded the precomputed caches with ../init.sh, then this code
# should simply read the precomputed results and return immediately
#
# However, you can also create your own set of orbits
# The results are automatically cached into ../caches/milkyway_orbits.hdf5
# To use with mpi parallelization on e.g. 8 processors:
#   mpirun -n 8 python -u create_orbits_mpi.py
# With the current parameter setup this will take a couple of hours. To
# first test that everything is working, you might wanna reduce e.g.
# the number of integration steps below, before executing at full length
